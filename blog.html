<!-- MARKET INFORMATIVENESS  -->
<p class="date">April 5, 2021</p>
<p class="title">Does AI make financial markets more informative?</p>
<p class="text">Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the exponential growth of data is transforming the way investors value companies. The techno-optimist view is that AI-augmented investors have a greater ability to forecast corporate success and identify valuable companies. This makes stock prices more informative about companies' prospect, which, so the argument goes, is socially valuable because informative stock prices provide accurate signals for resource allocation.</p>
<p class="text">This virtuous effect of AI hinges on the assumption that AI has made financial markets more informative. But does this assumption hold true in reality? <a href="blog/20210405-AI-informative-markets"><span class="more">Read more &#187;</span></a></p>

<!-- BELIEF  -->
<p class="date">January 11, 2021</p>
<p class="title">Belief formation in the stock market</p>
<p class="text">In <a href="blog/20201121-predictable-stock-market">the previous post</a>, we uncovered that the stock market can be predicted to a certain extent. Namely, the price-earnings (P/E) ratio forecasts future stock market returns. When the P/E ratio is high&mdash;that is, when stock prices are high relative to companies' earnings&mdash;the stock market performs poorly on average over the next business cycle. Conversely, when the P/E ratio is low&mdash;when stocks are cheap relative to companies' earnings&mdash;the stock market tends to perform well in the medium run.</p>
<p class="text">The first interpretation of this pattern is that it is a symptom of inefficient markets. When investors are irrationally optimistic, stocks become over-priced and future returns are predictably low&mdash;to the surprise of the optimistic investors.</p>
<p class="text">The second interpretation is that, in good economic times risk is low, so investors are willing to hold stocks even if the risk premium is low. In other words, investors understand that investing when the P/E ratio is high delivers lower returns than investing when the P/E ratio is low, and they are fine with this.</p>
<p class="text">How to determine which interpretation is correct?</p>
<p class="text">Two researchers came up with a simple idea: ask investors! <a href="blog/20210111-belief-formation"><span class="more">Read more &#187;</span></a></p>

<!-- PREDICTABILITY  -->
<p class="date">November 21, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Is the stock market predictable?</p>
<p class="text">The efficient market hypothesis posits that companies' stock prices reflect fundamental values at all time. The implication of market efficiency is that stocks are never over-valued or under-valued and therefore it is never a particularly good time or a particularly bad time to buy stocks. According to the efficient market hypothesis, it is always business as usual.</p>
<p class="text"><b>An early challenge to market efficiency came from American economist Robert J. Shiller.</b> Shiller noticed that the stock market is not only volatile, it is also mean reverting. Mean reversion means that, when the stock market is at a high level at a given point in time, it tends to subsequently go down. Conversely, if the stock market is at a low level today, it tends to go up in the future. <a href="blog/20201121-predictable-stock-market"><span class="more">Read more &#187;</span></a></p>

<p class="title">CAPM (mis)valuation in mergers and acquisitions</p>
<p class="text">We saw in the <a href="blog/20201010-capm-fake-news">previous post</a> that there is a discrepancy between CAPM-implied and actual stock returns. In other words, if you value a company using the discount rate implied by the CAPM, you obtain a different number than the market valuation.</p>
<p class="text">According to a recent survey of valuation professionals, most chief financial officers and investment bankers use the CAPM to value investment projects and companies. One important context in which the CAPM is commonly used is mergers and acquisitions. <a href="blog/20201025-capm-mna"><span class="more">Read more &#187;</span></a></p>

<p class="text">Corporations and non-profit organizations constantly make capital budgeting decisions: whether to build a new infrastructure, develop a green technology, launch a new business line, or acquire a company. Making right capital budgeting decisions requires to assess correctly the value of the future benefits generated by each project. Because these benefits are usually uncertain, their value must be discounted for risk. The CAPM tells us how to do this risk adjustment.</p>

Last year the parliament voted a law that opens the door to the privatization of Aéroports de Paris. There is strong popular pushback against the privatization.

<!-- STOCKS OLD OR YOUNG -->
<p class="date">October 3, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Should you buy stocks when young or old?</p>
<p class="text">One of the key insights of finance is that investors should invest in portfolios that contain the market portfolio of risky assets (such as stocks and corporate bonds) and the risk-free asset (government bonds). The share invested in risky assets should only depend on one's risk aversion. Therefore, people should invest a constant share of their <i>wealth</i> in stocks throughout their life (unless their risk aversion changes with age, but I am leaving this interesting question aside for today).</p>
<p class="text">One could be tempted to conclude that people should invest a constant share of their <i>savings</i> in stocks throughout their life. But this conclusion is not guaranteed because wealth is not the same as savings. An individual's wealth is made of her current savings as well as all the income she will earn throughout her life. Even if I have zero euros on my bank account, I am still rich of my future labor income! <a href="blog/20201003-stocks-life-cycle"><span class="more">Read more &#187;</span></a></p>

<p class="text">The five tech giants (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook) account for 20% of the total US stock market capitalization.

<p class="date">September 14, 2020</p>
<p class="title">How central banks influence the Net Present Value</p>
<p class="text">The job of central banks is to stabilize the business cycle, trying to prevent unemployment to rise during recessions and keeping inflation in check during expansions.</p>
<p class="text">To achieve these goals, the central bank sets the interest rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend money to each other. Because commercial banks are at the core of the financial system, the interbank rate determines the interest rates faced by businesses and households. The central bank therefore controls the interest rate in the economy.</p>

<p class="title">Covid increases debt owed to high-income people</p>
<p class="text">Businesses and governments come out of the lockdown with high levels of debt. This is a source of worries because high corporate debt can create debt overhang and hinder corporate investment (see <a href="blog/20200507-debt-overhang">this post</a>) and high government debt can lead to sovereign debt crises.</p>
<p class="text">An aspect of the situation that is less discussed but crucial is where the debt is coming from. When a single country endures hard times, it often borrows from other countries. This logic does not apply to the Covid crisis because all countries were hit &mdash; we don't borrow from Martians (yet?). It must be that a group of people <i>increased their savings</i> during the crisis and lent money to other economic agents. Who is this group of people?</p>

<p class="title">Should the EU issue perpetual bonds?</p>
<p class="text">The idea of issuing perpetual debt to combat the Covid crisis has recently been floated by prominent public figures such as hedge fund manager George Soros (<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/finance-european-union-recovery-with-perpetual-bonds-by-george-soros-2020-04" target="_blank">The EU Should Issue Perpetual Bonds</a>) and economist Luis Garicano and former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt (<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/european-union-covid-reconstruction-fund-by-guy-verhofstadt-and-luis-garicano-2020-04" target="_blank">Toward a European Reconstruction Fund</a>). A perpetual bond is a bond that pays an annual coupon forever and whose principal is never repaid. Conceptually, a perpetual bond is a coupon-paying bond with an infinite maturity.</p>
<img width="60%" src="blog/20200608.png">
<p class="text">The main argument for issuing perpetual bonds is that the EU should take advantage of the low-yield environment to lock in low interest rates by borrowing with infinite maturity.

<p class="title">May inflation risk be higher than suggested by the bond market?</p>
<p class="text">In the previous post we argued that bond prices point to expectations of low inflation. In the euro area, the difference between the yield on nominal bonds (subject to inflation risk) and the yield on inflation-indexed bonds (protected against inflation risk) is only 0.6%, which implies an expected inflation of 0.6% per year. In the US, the difference between the ten-year yield on nominal bonds (in blue on the figure below) and that on inflation-index bonds (in red) implies an expected inflation of 1.2% per year, which is also historically low.</p>

In other words, central banks are effectively financing governments by creating money.

In particular, central banks engaged in large asset purchase programs (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c0b78bc9-0ea8-461c-a5a2-89067ca94ea4" target="_blank">Federal Reserve enters new territory with support for risky debt</a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/41b3d01d-029b-469a-be4b-8b1967455472" target="_blank">ECB predicted to beef up asset purchases with shift into junk bonds</a>). What are these asset purchases and what are their goals?</p>
<p class="text">In a crisis, central banks seek to lower interest rates. The rationale is that lower interest rates induce companies to invest and households to consume. Lower interest rates also reduce the cost of government deficits and mitigate the risk of a sovereign debt crisis. Before seeing how central banks can affect interest rates, it is important to remember that interest rates have two components:</p>

<!-- STOCK MARKET CRASH COVID PART 1 -->
<p class="date"><a id="20200424"></a>April 24, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Were stock prices too high before Covid-19?</p>
<p class="text">The arrival of Covid-19 in Europe made stock markets crash. The two graphs below show that the S&P 500 (the US stock market index) and the EuroStoxx 50 (the European index) went down by about 30% after Northern Italy was quarantined at the end of February. Minus 30% sounds like a large drop, but was it too large: did the market over-react? Alternatively, were stock prices too high before the crisis and the crash a correction to more reasonable stock prices?</p>
<p class="text">In this post, we will use the tools learnt in Financial Markets to answer both questions, starting with the latter.</p>

<!-- NEGATIVE OIL PRICES  -->
<p class="date">April 21, 2020</p>
<p class="title"><a id="20200421"></a>Why is the price of oil futures negative at short maturities?</p>
<p class="text">You probably heard that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5292644-958d-4065-92e8-ace55d766654" target="_blank">oil price is below zero for the first time in history</a>. The screenshot below was sent to me by a student. The column "Last" shows the prices of futures oil contracts for several contract maturities. Remember that a futures contract calls for the delivery of the underlying asset (here: oil) at the maturity of the contract (May 2020, June 2020, etc.)</p>
<img width="80%" src="blog/20200421.png">
<p class="text">The amazing fact is that the contract for delivery in May has a negative price. It means that sellers are paying buyers for taking oil off their hands in May! But notice this is only true at short maturities: the June contract has a positive price as one would normally expect. How can we explain this pattern using what we learnt in Financial Markets?</p>
