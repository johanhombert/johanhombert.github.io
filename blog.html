<!-- WHO IS SAVING? -->
<p class="date">June 18, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Covid increases debt owed to high-income people</p>
<p class="text">Businesses and governments come out of the lockdown with high levels of debt. This is a source of worries because high corporate debt can create debt overhang and hinder corporate investment (see <a href="blog/20200507-debt-overhang">this post</a>) and high government debt can lead to sovereign debt crises.</p>
<p class="text">An aspect of the situation that is less discussed but crucial is where the debt is coming from. When a single country endures hard times, it often borrows from other countries. This logic does not apply to the Covid crisis because all countries were hit &mdash; we don't borrow from Martians (yet?). It must be that a group of people <i>increased their savings</i> during the crisis and lent money to other economic agents. Who is this group of people?</p>

<!-- PERPETUAL BONDS -->
<p class="date">June 08, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Should the EU issue perpetual bonds?</p>
<p class="text">The idea of issuing perpetual debt to combat the Covid crisis has recently been floated by prominent public figures such as hedge fund manager George Soros (<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/finance-european-union-recovery-with-perpetual-bonds-by-george-soros-2020-04" target="_blank">The EU Should Issue Perpetual Bonds</a>) and economist Luis Garicano and former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt (<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/european-union-covid-reconstruction-fund-by-guy-verhofstadt-and-luis-garicano-2020-04" target="_blank">Toward a European Reconstruction Fund</a>). A perpetual bond is a bond that pays an annual coupon forever and whose principal is never repaid. Conceptually, a perpetual bond is a coupon-paying bond with an infinite maturity.</p>
<img src="blog/20200608.png" width="400">
<p class="text">The main argument for issuing perpetual bonds is that the EU should take advantage of the low-yield environment to lock in low interest rates by borrowing with infinite maturity.

<!-- INFLATION OBJECTION -->
<p class="date">June 5, 2020</p>
<p class="title">May inflation risk be higher than suggested by the bond market?</p>
<p class="text">In the previous post we argued that bond prices point to expectations of low inflation. In the euro area, the difference between the yield on nominal bonds (subject to inflation risk) and the yield on inflation-indexed bonds (protected against inflation risk) is only 0.6%, which implies an expected inflation of 0.6% per year. In the US, the difference between the ten-year yield on nominal bonds (in blue on the figure below) and that on inflation-index bonds (in red) implies an expected inflation of 1.2% per year, which is also historically low.</p>
<img src="blog/20200605.png" width="800">
<p class="text">Can these prices actually be misleading? This post reviews possible objections to the conclusion drawn from bond prices.</p>

<!-- INFLATION -->
<p class="date">May 28, 2020</p>
<p class="title">What does the bond market tell us about inflation risk?</p>
<p class="text">The fiscal response to the crisis is pushing public debt to very high levels. Concomittantly, central banks purchase massive amounts of public debt to keep interest rates low. In other words, central banks are effectively financing governments by creating money. Historically, government financing by money creation led to dramatic episodes of hyperinflation as is currently happening in Venezuela. Is there inflation risk today in Europe?</p>

<!-- STOCK MARKET DISCONNECT -->

<p class="title">Is the stock market disconnected from the real economy?</p>
<p class="text">While unemployment is reaching levels not seen since the Great Depression and many small and large businesses are in dire financial situation, the stock market enjoyed very good returns over the past weeks. Is the stock market disconnected from the real economy?</p>
<p class="text">The disconnect is only apparent. Several factors explain why stock prices can increase even though economic conditions deteriorate.</p>

<!-- MONEY CREATION PART 3 -->
<p class="date">May 14, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Can social objectives be financed by money creation?</p>
<p class="title">Final part</p>
<p class="text">There exist many proposals for financing the energy transition, medical research, anti-poverty programmes and other social objectives, by creating money. They often boil down to something like this. The government aims at funding expenses, say medical research for a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p class="text">Step 1: The government fund expenses by issuing debt.</p>
<p class="text">Step 2: The central bank purchases the government debt. The government never repays the debt.</p>

<p class="text">We showed <a href="blog/20200512-money-creation-part1">in Part 1</a> that commercial banks create money. We considered a banking sector with balance sheet:</p>

<!-- MONEY CREATION PART 1 -->
<p class="date">May 12, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Can social objectives be financed by money creation?</p>
<p class="text">Can states finance social objectives such as the energy transition, developing a coronavirus vaccine or reducing poverty, by creating money? We often hear proposals involving a combination of innovative debt instruments and central bank intervention to finance laudable objectives (see for instance Thomas Piketty on "green money" in <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/05/09/apres-la-crise-le-temps-de-la-monnaie-verte_6039129_3232.html" target="_blank">LeMonde.fr</a>). These proposals are usually criticized on the ground that they would lead to inflation and asset bubbles.</p>
<p class="text">Unfortunately, the debate is often arcane and sometimes based on misconceptions about money. My goal here is not to take a side, but to explain plainly how money creation works in practice.</p>

<!-- DEBT OVERHANG -->
<p class="date">May 7, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Debt overhang is looming: Is it curable?</p>
<p class="text">Many businesses are in financial troubles due to reduced economic activity caused by Covid. Governments are taking actions to help firms survive through these hard times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/26af5520-6793-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3" target="_blank">ranging from tax holidays to government loans and credit guarantees</a>. But when economic activity resumes, firms will emerge with high levels of debt accumulated during the crisis, leading to a well-known problem: debt overhang. What is debt overhang and how can it be cured?</p>

<!-- CENTRAL BANKS ASSET PURCHASES -->
<p class="date">May 3, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Why central banks purchase risky debt</p>
<p class="text">Central banks massively intervened during the crisis. In particular, central banks engaged in large asset purchase programs (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c0b78bc9-0ea8-461c-a5a2-89067ca94ea4" target="_blank">Federal Reserve enters new territory with support for risky debt</a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/41b3d01d-029b-469a-be4b-8b1967455472" target="_blank">ECB predicted to beef up asset purchases with shift into junk bonds</a>). What are these asset purchases and what are their goals?</p>
<p class="text">In a crisis, central banks seek to lower interest rates. The rationale is that lower interest rates induce companies to invest and households to consume. Lower interest rates also reduce the cost of government deficits and mitigate the risk of a sovereign debt crisis. Before seeing how central banks can affect interest rates, it is important to remember that interest rates have two components:</p>
<p class="text">Interest rate = Risk-free rate + Default premium</p>
<p class="text">The risk-free rate is the interest rate at which you can borrow money when it is expected you will repay your debt for sure. But when creditors expect you may default on your debt with some probability, you will be charged a higher interest rate: the additional premium you must pay on top of the risk-free rate is called the default premium. The higher the risk of default, the higher the default premium. The default premium is also called the credit spread, so I will use both expressions interchangeably.</p>

<!-- STOCK MARKET CRASH COVID PART 3 -->

<p class="title">Why the equity risk premium has increased</p>
<p class="text">The stock market rebounded following fiscal and monetary policy announcements: it is now about 20% below its pre-crisis level. <a href="20200426-covid-market-crash-part2">In the previous post</a>, we saw that the expected fall in corporate earnings can account for only a fraction of the market decline. To explain the full market decline (even after the rebound), we must recognize that the equity risk premium has gone up.</p>
<p class="text">There exist three reasons why the equity risk premium has increased, which are summarized by the following formula:</p>
<p class="text">Equity risk premium = (Risk aversion) x (Macro risk) x (Sensitivity of earnings to macro risk)</p>

<p class="title">Did the stock market over-react to Covid-19?</p>
<p class="text"><a href="blog/20200424-covid-market-crash-part1">In the previous post</a> we saw that the Dividend Discount Model does a good job at explaining the level of stock prices before the Covid crisis. Today, we turn to the stock market crash caused by the coronavirus outbreak. After stock prices went down 30%, some commentators argued the market over-reacted. Let us review their arguments as well as counter-arguments using the Dividend Discount Model.</p>

<p class="title">Were stock prices too high before Covid-19?</p>
<p class="text">The arrival of Covid-19 in Europe made stock markets crash. The two graphs below show that the S&P 500 (the US stock market index) and the EuroStoxx 50 (the European index) went down by about 30% after Northern Italy was quarantined at the end of February. Minus 30% sounds like a large drop, but was it too large: did the market over-react? Alternatively, were stock prices too high before the crisis and the crash a correction to more reasonable stock prices?</p>
<p class="text">In this post, we will use the tools learnt in Financial Markets to answer both questions, starting with the latter.</p>

<!-- NEGATIVE OIL PRICES  -->
<p class="date">April 21, 2020</p>
<p class="title"><a id="20200421"></a>Why is the price of oil futures negative at short maturities?</p>
<p class="text">You probably heard that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5292644-958d-4065-92e8-ace55d766654" target="_blank">oil price is below zero for the first time in history</a>. The screenshot below was sent to me by a student. The column "Last" shows the prices of futures oil contracts for several contract maturities. Remember that a futures contract calls for the delivery of the underlying asset (here: oil) at the maturity of the contract (May 2020, June 2020, etc.)</p>
<p align="center"><img src="blog/20200421.png" width="500" border="0"></p>
<p class="text">The amazing fact is that the contract for delivery in May has a negative price. It means that sellers are paying buyers for taking oil off their hands in May! But notice this is only true at short maturities: the June contract has a positive price as one would normally expect. How can we explain this pattern using what we learnt in Financial Markets?</p>
