<!-- TECH GIANTS -->
<p class="date">September 29, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Is the stock market over-exposed to the tech giants?</p>
<p class="text">The five tech giants (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook) account for 20% of the total US stock market capitalization. This fact leads some financial advisors to say that investors holding the market portfolio are poorly diversified, because they are over-exposed to the tech sector and a handful of tech companies (an example of this view <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/28/sp-500-dominated-by-apple-microsoft-alphabet-amazon-facebook.html" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

<p class="title">How to evaluate private equity funds: IRR v. NPV</p>
<p class="text">We learn in finance class that investments should be evaluated based on their Net Present Value. It turns out that many private equity funds instead use the Internal Rate of Return to advertise their performance. Did we learn something wrong in class? Or do private equity funds have a (good or bad) reason to communicate their internal rate of return?</p>

<p class="date">September 17, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Why interest rates don't go below zero &mdash; and why digital currencies can change it</p>
<p class="text">Central banks set the interest rate to influence investment decisions, raising the interest rate to moderate investment when the economy is booming and lowering the interest rate to boost investment when the economy is slowing down (see the <a href="blog/20200914-central-banks-npv">previous post</a>). But how low can the central bank set the interest rate?</p>

<!-- CENTRAL BANK NPV -->
<p class="date">September 14, 2020</p>
<p class="title">How central banks influence the Net Present Value</p>
<p class="text">The job of central banks is to stabilize the business cycle, trying to prevent unemployment to rise during recessions and keeping inflation in check during expansions.</p>
<p class="text">To achieve these goals, the central bank sets the interest rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend money to each other. Because commercial banks are at the core of the financial system, the interbank rate determines the interest rates faced by businesses and households. The central bank therefore controls the interest rate in the economy.</p>

<p class="title">How to deal with the coming wave of corporate bankruptcies?</p>
<p class="text">Businesses have accumulated lots of debt since the beginning of the Covid-19 health and economic crisis. High corporate debt creates two sorts of issues. The first one is debt overhang that hinders corporate investment &ndash; see <a href="blog/20200507-debt-overhang" target="_blank">this post</a> on debt overhang and public policies aimed at fixing it.</p>
<p class="text">The second issue is financial distress. Corporate bankruptcies are now rising around the world &ndash; see for instance <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/277dc354-a870-4160-9117-b5b0dece5360" target="_blank">Pandemic triggers wave of billion-dollar US bankruptcies</a> in the Financial Times.

<!-- WHO IS SAVING? -->
<p class="date">June 18, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Covid increases debt owed to high-income people</p>
<p class="text">Businesses and governments come out of the lockdown with high levels of debt. This is a source of worries because high corporate debt can create debt overhang and hinder corporate investment (see <a href="blog/20200507-debt-overhang">this post</a>) and high government debt can lead to sovereign debt crises.</p>
<p class="text">An aspect of the situation that is less discussed but crucial is where the debt is coming from. When a single country endures hard times, it often borrows from other countries. This logic does not apply to the Covid crisis because all countries were hit &mdash; we don't borrow from Martians (yet?). It must be that a group of people <i>increased their savings</i> during the crisis and lent money to other economic agents. Who is this group of people?</p>

<!-- PERPETUAL BONDS -->
<p class="date">June 08, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Should the EU issue perpetual bonds?</p>
<p class="text">The idea of issuing perpetual debt to combat the Covid crisis has recently been floated by prominent public figures such as hedge fund manager George Soros (<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/finance-european-union-recovery-with-perpetual-bonds-by-george-soros-2020-04" target="_blank">The EU Should Issue Perpetual Bonds</a>) and economist Luis Garicano and former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt (<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/european-union-covid-reconstruction-fund-by-guy-verhofstadt-and-luis-garicano-2020-04" target="_blank">Toward a European Reconstruction Fund</a>). A perpetual bond is a bond that pays an annual coupon forever and whose principal is never repaid. Conceptually, a perpetual bond is a coupon-paying bond with an infinite maturity.</p>
<img width="60%" src="blog/20200608.png">
<p class="text">The main argument for issuing perpetual bonds is that the EU should take advantage of the low-yield environment to lock in low interest rates by borrowing with infinite maturity.

<!-- INFLATION OBJECTION -->
<p class="date">June 5, 2020</p>
<p class="title">May inflation risk be higher than suggested by the bond market?</p>
<p class="text">In the previous post we argued that bond prices point to expectations of low inflation. In the euro area, the difference between the yield on nominal bonds (subject to inflation risk) and the yield on inflation-indexed bonds (protected against inflation risk) is only 0.6%, which implies an expected inflation of 0.6% per year. In the US, the difference between the ten-year yield on nominal bonds (in blue on the figure below) and that on inflation-index bonds (in red) implies an expected inflation of 1.2% per year, which is also historically low.</p>

<p class="text">Can these prices actually be misleading? This post reviews possible objections to the conclusion drawn from bond prices.</p>

<!-- INFLATION -->
<p class="date">May 28, 2020</p>
<p class="title">What does the bond market tell us about inflation risk?</p>
<p class="text">The fiscal response to the crisis is pushing public debt to very high levels. Concomittantly, central banks purchase massive amounts of public debt to keep interest rates low. In other words, central banks are effectively financing governments by creating money. Historically, government financing by money creation led to dramatic episodes of hyperinflation as is currently happening in Venezuela. Is there inflation risk today in Europe?</p>

<p class="title">Can social objectives be financed by money creation?</p>
<p class="text">Can states finance social objectives such as the energy transition, developing a coronavirus vaccine or reducing poverty, by creating money? We often hear proposals involving a combination of innovative debt instruments and central bank intervention to finance laudable objectives (see for instance Thomas Piketty on "green money" in <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/05/09/apres-la-crise-le-temps-de-la-monnaie-verte_6039129_3232.html" target="_blank">LeMonde.fr</a>). These proposals are usually criticized on the ground that they would lead to inflation and asset bubbles.</p>

<p class="title">Debt overhang is looming: Is it curable?</p>
<p class="text">Many businesses are in financial troubles due to reduced economic activity caused by Covid. Governments are taking actions to help firms survive through these hard times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/26af5520-6793-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3" target="_blank">ranging from tax holidays to government loans and credit guarantees</a>. But when economic activity resumes, firms will emerge with high levels of debt accumulated during the crisis, leading to a well-known problem: debt overhang. What is debt overhang and how can it be cured?</p>

<!-- CENTRAL BANKS ASSET PURCHASES -->
<p class="date">May 3, 2020</p>
<p class="title">Why central banks purchase risky debt</p>
<p class="text">Central banks massively intervened during the crisis. In particular, central banks engaged in large asset purchase programs (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c0b78bc9-0ea8-461c-a5a2-89067ca94ea4" target="_blank">Federal Reserve enters new territory with support for risky debt</a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/41b3d01d-029b-469a-be4b-8b1967455472" target="_blank">ECB predicted to beef up asset purchases with shift into junk bonds</a>). What are these asset purchases and what are their goals?</p>
<p class="text">In a crisis, central banks seek to lower interest rates. The rationale is that lower interest rates induce companies to invest and households to consume. Lower interest rates also reduce the cost of government deficits and mitigate the risk of a sovereign debt crisis. Before seeing how central banks can affect interest rates, it is important to remember that interest rates have two components:</p>
<p class="text">Interest rate = Risk-free rate + Default premium</p>

<!-- STOCK MARKET CRASH COVID PART 3 -->

<p class="title">Why the equity risk premium has increased</p>
<p class="text">The stock market rebounded following fiscal and monetary policy announcements: it is now about 20% below its pre-crisis level. <a href="20200426-covid-market-crash-part2">In the previous post</a>, we saw that the expected fall in corporate earnings can account for only a fraction of the market decline. To explain the full market decline (even after the rebound), we must recognize that the equity risk premium has gone up.</p>
<p class="text">There exist three reasons why the equity risk premium has increased, which are summarized by the following formula:</p>
<p class="text">Equity risk premium = (Risk aversion) x (Macro risk) x (Sensitivity of earnings to macro risk)</p>

The two graphs below show that the S&P 500 (the US stock market index) and the EuroStoxx 50 (the European index) went down by about 30% after Northern Italy was quarantined at the end of February. Minus 30% sounds like a large drop, but was it too large: did the market over-react? Alternatively, were stock prices too high before the crisis and the crash a correction to more reasonable stock prices?</p>

<!-- NEGATIVE OIL PRICES  -->
<p class="date">April 21, 2020</p>
<p class="title"><a id="20200421"></a>Why is the price of oil futures negative at short maturities?</p>
<p class="text">You probably heard that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5292644-958d-4065-92e8-ace55d766654" target="_blank">oil price is below zero for the first time in history</a>. The screenshot below was sent to me by a student. The column "Last" shows the prices of futures oil contracts for several contract maturities. Remember that a futures contract calls for the delivery of the underlying asset (here: oil) at the maturity of the contract (May 2020, June 2020, etc.)</p>
<img width="80%" src="blog/20200421.png">
<p class="text">The amazing fact is that the contract for delivery in May has a negative price. It means that sellers are paying buyers for taking oil off their hands in May! But notice this is only true at short maturities: the June contract has a positive price as one would normally expect. How can we explain this pattern using what we learnt in Financial Markets?</p>
