<!-- STOCK MARKET CRASH COVID PART 2 -->
<p class="date"><a id="20200426"></a>April 26, 2020</p>
<p class="title" align="justify">Did the stock market over-react to Covid-19?</p>
<p class="text" align="justify"><a href="blog/20200424-covid-market-crash-part1">In the previous post</a> we saw that the Dividend Discount Model does a good job at explaining the level of stock prices before the Covid crisis. Today, we turn to the stock market crash caused by the coronavirus outbreak. After stock prices went down 30%, some commentators argued the market over-reacted. Let us review their arguments as well as counter-arguments using the Dividend Discount Model.</p>

<!-- STOCK MARKET CRASH COVID PART 1 -->
<p class="date"><a id="20200424"></a>April 24, 2020</p>
<p class="title" align="justify">Were stock prices too high before Covid-19?</p>
<p class="text" align="justify">The arrival of Covid-19 in Europe made stock markets crash. The two graphs below show that the S&P 500 (the US stock market index) and the EuroStoxx 50 (the European index) went down by about 30% after Northern Italy was quarantined at the end of February. Minus 30% sounds like a large drop, but was it too large: did the market over-react? Alternatively, were stock prices too high before the crisis and the crash a correction to more reasonable stock prices?</p>
<p class="text" align="justify">In this post, we will use the tools learnt in Financial Markets to answer both questions, starting with the latter.</p>

<!-- NEGATIVE OIL PRICES  -->
<p class="date">April 21, 2020</p>
<p class="title"><a id="20200421"></a>Why is the price of oil futures negative at short maturities?</p>
<p class="text" align="justify">You probably heard that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5292644-958d-4065-92e8-ace55d766654" target="_blank">oil price is below zero for the first time in history</a>. The screenshot below was sent to me by a student. The column "Last" shows the prices of futures oil contracts for several contract maturities. Remember that a futures contract calls for the delivery of the underlying asset (here: oil) at the maturity of the contract (May 2020, June 2020, etc.)</p>
<p align="center"><img src="blog/20200421.png" width="500" border="0"></p>
<p class="text" align="justify">The amazing fact is that the contract for delivery in May has a negative price. It means that sellers are paying buyers for taking oil off their hands in May! But notice this is only true at short maturities: the June contract has a positive price as one would normally expect. How can we explain this pattern using what we learnt in Financial Markets?</p>
