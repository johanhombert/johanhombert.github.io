<p class="text">We saw in the previous post that there is a discrepancy between CAPM-implied and actual stock returns.
In other words, if you value a company using the discount rate implied by the CAPM, you obtain a different number than the market valuation.
What happens when the CAPM-valuation and the market valuation meet in the real world?</p>

<p class="text">Most chief financial officers and investment bankers commonly use the CAPM to value investment projects and companies (76% of valuation professionals use the CAPM always or almost always according to a recent survey).
<!-- The Choice of Valuation Techniques in Practice: Education versus Profession -->
One important investment decision when the CAPM is commonly used is in mergers and acquisitions.</p>

Dessaint, Olivier, Otto, Thesmar show that the market values of companies who engage in acquisitions using the CAPM to value their targets see their market value impacted by the beta of the target. As shown in the graph below, acquirors of a low beta targets see their stock price dropping whereas acquirors of high beta targets see their stock price rise.

<p class="text">Suppose a public company acquires a private company (recall that "public" means listed in the stock market and "private" means unlisted).
Suppose the target company is a low beta company.
The acquiring company hires investment bankers to value the target company.
Suppose the target company is a low beta company and the bankers use the CAPM to value the target.
Since the target has a low beta, they use a low discount rate and therefore value the target at a relatively high price.</p>

<p class="text">As we saw in the previous post, the relation between the beta of a stock and its average return is weaker in the stock market than it is in the CAPM. Therefore, the market-based value of the low beta target is determined by a higher discount rate, and therefore higher than the CAPM-based value.</p>

<p class="text">If the acquiror uses the CAPM to determine the price at which it pays the target, it will overpay compared to the market-based valuation. If the acquiror is itself listed in the market, its market value will decrease because the market estimates that it overpaid for the target.</p>

<p class="text">Finding out whether the market-based valuation or the CAPM-based valuation is correct is a difficult, not-yet-settled question, and is the subject of active research.</p>
