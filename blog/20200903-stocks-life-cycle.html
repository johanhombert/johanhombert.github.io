<p class="title">Should you buy stocks when young or old?</p>

<p class="text">One of the key insights of finance is that investors should invest in a portfolio that contains the market portfolio of risky assets (such as stocks and corporate bonds) and the risk-free asset (government bonds). The share invested in risky assets should only depend on one's risk aversion. Therefore, people should invest a constant share of their <i>wealth</i> in stocks throughout their life (unless their attitudes towards risk change with age, but I am leaving this interesting question aside for today).</p>

<p class="text">One could be tempted to conclude that people should invest a constant share of their <i>savings</i> in stocks throughout their life. But this conclusion is not guaranteed because wealth is not the same as savings. An individual's wealth is made of her current savings as well as all the income she will earn throughout their life. Even if I have zero euros on my bank account, I am still rich of my future labor income!</p>

<p class="text"><b>The notion that future wages are part of one's wealth led 1997 Nobel laureate Robert Merton to recommend that people should invest more in stocks when they are young than when they are old.</b></p>

<p class="text">Merton's idea was that wages tend to be relatively stable compared to the volatility of stocks, so the stream of future wages can be seen as a low-risk asset. When we are young, we have a long stream of future wages to come, so we have a large endowment in a low-risk asset, therefore we should invest our financial portfolio in more risky assets. Conversely, older people have little future wages but more financial wealth, so they should invest their financial portfolio more cautiously.</p>

<p class="text">This idea is the rationale for the recommendation usually given by financial advisors that the fraction of stocks in one's portfolio should decrease with age.</p>

<p class="text"><b>This recommendation relies on the assumption that labor income is safe. But this is not quite true in reality. </b> Wages are sticky in the short run, but they are highly correlated with economic growth and stock prices in the long term: wages grow fast in fast-growing economies and stagnate in stagnating economies.</p>

<p class="text">Recent research by HEC graduate Sylvain Catherine (alumnus of both the Grande Ecole and the PhD program, now professor at Wharton) studies how the fact that wages are risky and correlated with the stock market affects households' optimal portfolio allocation. Sylvain argues that because the young are exposed to labor market risk, they should invest more cautiously than the old, overturning the Merton conclusion and financial advisors' wisdom. If you are interested by this question, I encourage you to have a look at Sylvain's research <a href="https://sylvaincatherine.net/research/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
