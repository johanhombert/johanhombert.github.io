<p class="text">Stock prices provide useful signals for resource allocation. Corporate managers pay close attention to stock prices and their decisions are certainly influenced by the stock price of their company. Banks and bond investors also watch the stock price of companies they consider lending to. Therefore stock prices affect listed firms' ability to raise debt. Companies also monitor the stock prices of other companies because these prices contain information about which product markets and technologies are deemed promising.</p>

<p class="text">This is at least what finance theory claims: accurate stock prices are useful because they contain information for decision-makers. But what is the evidence for this theory?</p>

<p class="text">A recent article by DFFM evaluate this theory using data on stock prices and corporate investment decisions. The first pattern they uncover in the data is that firms increase investment when their stock price is higher. However, one should cautious when interpreting this fact because correlation is not causation. It could be that firms that invest more have high stock prices <i>because</i> they have good investment opportunities, rather than the other way around. That is, it is unclear whether causality runs from stock prices to corporate investment or from corporate investment to stock prices.</p>

<p class="text">To establish causality, the researchers identify situations in which the stock price is high for reasons unrelated to the investment opportunities of the company. When a mutual fund faces redemptions by its investors, the fund must sell a fraction of its portfolio, which push down the stock price of companies in its portfolio. This decline in stock prices has nothing to do with the investment opportunities of companies in the fund's portfolios.</p>

<p class="text">Strikingly, the researchers find that companies cut investment when the stock price drops for such non-fundamental reasons. This result has two implications. First, stock prices are not a side show. They have an impact on real investment decisions. Second, the informativeness (or lack thereof) of stock prices has real consequences. When stock prices move for non-fundamental reasons, this affects corporate investment in a way that is inefficient.</p>

<p class="text"><b>Spillovers</b></p>

<p class="text">DFFM uncover another fascinating pattern. They show that when the stock price of a company also impacts investment decisions by <i>other</i> companies in the same industry. The reason is that information about a given firm is relevant for companies that are similar. The paper is limited to listed firms but one can speculate that the logic extends to private firms and startups. The valuation of public companies can influence strategic and innovation decisions of entrepreneurs and investment choices of venture capitalists. This would only reinforce the importance of having well-functioning financial markets to provide accurate signal for resource allocation.</p>
