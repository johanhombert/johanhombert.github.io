<p class="title">Is the stock market disconnected from the real economy?</p>

<p class="text">While the stock market investors have been enjoying very good returns in the past weeks, unemployment is reaching levels not seen since the Great Depression and many small and large businesses are in dire financial situation. Is the stock market disconnected from the real economy?</p>

<img src="20200525.png"></a>

<p class="text">The disconnect is only apparent. Several factors explain why stock prices can increase even though economic conditions deteriorate.</p>

<p class="text">First and foremost, stock prices are forward looking. According to the Dividend Discount Model, stock prices are equal to the present value of current and <i>future</i> dividends. Current dividends are only a tiny fraction of total stock value. If the economy is currently doing poorly but expectations about the future improve, stock prices go up. This is likely what we are experiencing right now. (Also keep in mind that stock prices today remain below their pre-crisis level despite the recent surge.)</p>

<p class="text">Second, stock prices are equal to the <i>present value</i> of future dividends, that is, discounted dividends. The lower the discount rate, the higher the present value of future dividends. The discount rate for stocks is equal to the risk-free rate plus the equity risk premium. Since the beginning of the crisis, the risk-free rate has decreased by about one point due to central bank intervention (see <a href="">this post</a>). Lower interest rates therefore contribute to increasing stock prices.</p>

<p class="text">A third, more debatable factor might be at play. Tech companies have been doing well during the crisis as everything was moving online. One might argue that the crisis has triggered a permanent shift to more online economic activity, which benefits tech giants more than (or perhaps, to the detriment of) the rest of the economy. Since tech giants are listed companies whereas small and medium-sized companies are not, profits of listed companies may grow faster in the future than profits in the rest of the economy.</p>
