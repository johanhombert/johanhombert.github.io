<p class="title">How to value green investments (and eat chocolate)?</p>

<p class="text">The first thing we learn in finance classes is how to value for-profit investments. An investment project is worth the present value of the cash flow it generates, which we calculate as expected cash flow discounted at the appropriate rate.</p>

<p class="text">Can we adapt the method for nonprofit investments whose output is not pecuniary but environmental or social? The answer is yes!</p>

<p class="text">The main idea of discounting cash flow is that money in the future is worth less than money today and uncertain cash flow is worth less than certain cash flow.</p>

<p class="text">The same logic applies to investments that produce environmental benefits: future environmental gains are worth less than present ones; uncertain environmental gains are worth less than certain ones.</p>

<p class="text">We can illustrate this principle with two examples, one straightforward and one more subtle.</p>

<p class="text"><b><i>1. Early gains are more valuable than late gains</i></b></p>

<p class="text">Consider two investment projects in green technologies that aim at reducing carbon emissions. Project A leads to a 100 million tons (Mt) reduction in carbon emission at an horizon of two years. Project B generates the reduction in carbon emission but it does so at an horizon of four years. The development cost is the same for both projects.</p>

<p class="text">We naturally prefer project A over project B because its gains are earlier. This is an illustration of time discounting.</p>

<p class="text"><b><i>2. Certain gains are more valuable than uncertain gains &mdash; but there's a twist to it!</i></b></p>

<p class="text">Project X uses a proven technology and leads to a certain 200 Mt reduction in carbon emission in ten years. Project Y uses an uncertain technology: it may work and reduce carbon emissions by 400 Mt in ten year; it may also fail and deliver no gains. Project Y's success depends on external factors out of our control; success and failure are equally likely. The development cost is the same for both projects. Which project do you prefer?</p>

<p class="text">Risk discounting implies you should select project X because it generates the same expected gain as project Y (the expected emission reduction is 200 Mt for both projects) with lower risk.</p>

<p class="text">There is a twist, however. Situations exist in which we should pick project Y over project X because the uncertainty over the environmental benefits of project Y is valuable. Can you see in which situation this could happen?</p>

<p class="text">If you already completed the Financial Economics course, you should know the answer. If you are currently following the course, you don't know yet but can still try to guess!</p>

<p class="text">Now, chocolate. Email me your answer before Monday midnight: there is a chocolate box to win. I will draw lots among the correct answers coming from students currently on campus to determine the winner. (Chocolate delivered on campus only to save carbon!)</p>
