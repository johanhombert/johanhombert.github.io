<p class="title" align="justify">Can [your favorite social objective] be financed by money creation?</p>

<p class="text" align="justify">Can states finance social objectives such as the energy transition, developing a coronavirus vaccine or reducing poverty, by creating money? We often hear proposals involving a combination of innovative debt instruments and central bank intervention to finance social objectives (see for instance Thomas Piketty on "green money" in <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/05/09/apres-la-crise-le-temps-de-la-monnaie-verte_6039129_3232.html" target="_blank">LeMonde.fr</a>). Such proposal are often criticised on the ground that money creation leads to inflation and bubbles.</p>

<p class="text" align="justify">Unfortunately, the debate is often arcane and sometimes based on misconceptions about money. My goal here is not to take a side, but to explain plainly how money creation works and what its consequences are.</p>

<p class="title" align="justify">Part 1: Who creates money?</p>

<a href="https://vimeo.com/145170770" target="_blank"><img src="money.png"></a>

<p class="text" align="justify">Let us start from the real economy. Alice owns a real asset. It may be a house, a machine Alice uses to produce goods, the patent of an invention Alice made, and so on. Note that "real" is not synonymous with "tangible": a patent is an intangible asset, yet it is a real asset in that it grants Alice with intellectual property rights over her invention.</p>

<p class="text" align="justify">Alice sells her asset to Bob at price 100. Bob has no wealth, so he takes a loan at the bank to pay Alice.</p>

<p class="text" align="justify">Let us now turn to the financial (or monetary) side of the economy. The bank writes a loan to Bob. The loan appears on the bank's balance sheet as an asset, because the bank has a claim of 100 on Bob. Simultaneously, the bank credits Alice's bank account by 100. The money on bank accounts are called deposits. Deposits show up as liabilities on banks' balance sheet, because they represent a claim Alice has on the bank. The balance sheet of the bank is as follows:</p>

<p class="text" align="center">
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
 <tr>
  <th width="150">Assets</th>
  <th width="150">Liabilities</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td colspan="2" align="center">Bank's balance sheet</td>
 </tr> 
 <tr valign="top">
  <td><table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">
    <tr><td width="100">Loans</td><td>100</td></tr>
  </table></td>
  <td><table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">
    <tr><td width="100">Deposits</td><td>100</td></tr>
  </table></td>
 </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p class="text" align="center">
<caption align="top">Bank's balance sheet</caption>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
 <tr>
  <th width="150">Assets</th>
  <th width="150">Liabilities</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Loans: 100</td>
  <td>Deposits: 100</td>
 </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p class="text" align="justify">Let us now state a first fact about money:</p>

<p class="text" align="justify"><b>Fact 1:</b> Bank deposits are money.</p>

<p class="text" align="justify">The key property of money is that it can be used to make transactions. Bank deposits have this property. If Alice wants to buy goods from Bob, she can pay by transferring deposit value from her to Bob. This can be done in multiple ways: card payment, wire transfer, check, etc. Bank deposits are therefore money.</p>

<p class="text" align="justify">Note that transactions between households do not affect the balance sheet of the bank. If Alice buys 20 worth of goods from Bob, the bank still has 100 of deposits which are split into 80 for Alice and 20 for Bob. If Alice and Bob have their accounts in different banks, transactions between Alice and Bob affect the balance sheet of individual banks but not that of the banking sector as a whole. Therefore, the bank's balance sheet represented above should be thought as the aggregate balance sheet of the banking sector.</p>

<p class="text" align="justify">This example shows the special role of banks: when banks extend credit, they create money in the process. This leads us to our second fact about money:</p>

<p class="text" align="justify"><b>Fact 2:</b> Commercial banks create money.</p>

<p class="text" align="justify">This example also shows that money creation does not require a central bank. In fact, commercial banks existed before central banks: the US Fed was only created in 1913.</p>

<p class="text" align="justify">In the next post, we will see how the government and the central bank are also involved in money creation. To be continued...</p>
